                        <p> Inline: This is used when the user wants to change a object on one page with out changing similar objects of other pages for example if a person wanted to change a heading on a page to a different colour, but using inline CSS this is how could do it. However by using inline it can be very in efficient  as this may need to be repeated which means that inline can be very time consuming to use. Internal: This type of CSS styling is written within the header of a webpage, below the title tags and placed within style tags so the browser knows that that is the CSS code needed, by using inline CSS styling this ad the clear advantage over inline as there will be less repeated coding when wanting to change an item which also means it’s a time saving                       measure, although this will still have to be repeated on every wag that the website has. External:  The most common type of styling, External CSS uses style sheets that are created and located within the same folder in which 
the website is stored in to. These styles will be applied to all of the pages that are between the ‘html‘ tags.
Which is also its main advantage, the fact that it is applied to all of the sites webpages which reduces unnecessary lines of code and save   
the programmer time.</p>

                    <h3>The box model</h3>
                        <p> The margin is the furthest out from the content in which the user wants to add to website. The purpose of the margin is to properly space out each element of the webpage as it can allow for equal spacing of elements of the website by placing the margins next to each other. The Border is not only a technical term but also a decoctive term as this will be a border will be place around the item. For example a dashed or solid line to define a object on the site whether it is text or a photo. An example of a border is shown in the diagram to the right. The ‘box model’ is a term that is used what we are  using CSS to design and layout a website. The model is the way in which a website is classed in terms of  area of the website. Classed with four different areas; Margin, Border, Padding and Content which all makes up an HTML item. The content box of the box method is self explanatory, this is where the actual    objects that the user wants to add is held. For example if the user wants to add an image, this can be done by placing the images file name in between ‘<img>‘ tags with text being in between ‘div’ tags. Padding will define how far the border should be away from the actual object (text or image), as this stops the border from being to close to the object as if the order is too close, it can make hard and difficult to read text the is on the website. So with a few pixels gaps, padding prevents this. </p>
